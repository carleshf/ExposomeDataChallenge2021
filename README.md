__Timeline__ (from the official webpage):

  * February 18: Exposome dataset available [here](https://github.com/isglobal-exposomeHub/ExposomeDataChallenge2021/blob/main/README.md).
  * March 4: _We submitted this proposal_.
  * March 8: Proposal submission deadline `-->` updated to March 12.
  * March 15: Proposal selection results `-->` updated to March 22.
  * March-April: Time for the selected participants to apply their method on the Exposome dataset provided.
  * April 28: Selected participants apply their methods on the Exposome dataset provided, submit the results and codes on the event Github page.
  * April 28-30: Showcase of the results and discussion. Selected participants present their methods and results on the Exposome dataset provided. The results and codes will be submitted on the event Github page.

__Status__ :

1. This abstract has been selected for the _Topic 2 - Muti-omic data integration_ chaired by __Juan Ramón González__ on Wednesday, April 28th, 4:45 - 6:00 PM (CET time).

2. After performing the initial analyses and overved that results were not conlusice, we decided to retract our proposal form the event.

__Analyses__:

0. Abstract with the plan [here](https://github.com/carleshf/ExposomeDataChallenge2021/tree/main/abstract).
1. Dimensionallity reduction of exposure data using PCA [here](https://github.com/carleshf/ExposomeDataChallenge2021/blob/main/analyses/exposure_pca.md).
2. Dimensionallity reduction of metabolome data using PCA and its association analysis with reduced exposome [here](https://github.com/carleshf/ExposomeDataChallenge2021/blob/main/analyses/metabolome_pca_path_assoc.md)
